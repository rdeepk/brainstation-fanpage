                    <h4>About Zakir Hussain</h4>
                    <p>Zakir Hussain is appreciated both in the field of percussion and in the music world at large as an international
                        phenomenon and one of the greatest musicians of our time. A classical tabla virtuoso of the highest
                        order, his consistently brilliant and exciting performances have established him as a national treasure
                        in his own country, India, and as one of India’s reigning cultural ambassadors. Along with his legendary
                        father and teacher, Ustad Allarakha, he has elevated the status of his instrument both in India and
                        around the world.</p>
                    <p>For the maestro, who is the scion of North Indian music's greatest percussion dynasty, the move from
                        Mumbai to Marin County, California, in the early 1970s opened up vast new musical realms for exploration,
                        and no relationship has played a more essential role in his journey than SFJazz.</p>

                    <p>In 2016, Zakir Hussain was amongst many legendary Jazz, World and Fusion musicians invited by President
                        Obama to the International Jazz Day 2016 All-Star Global Concert at the White House.</p>

                        <h4>As a Professor</h4>
                        <p>He was named an Old Dominion Fellow by the Humanities Council at Princeton University, where he resided
                            for the 2005–2006 semester as full professor in the music department. He was also a visiting
                            professor at Stanford University. He now resides in San Francisco.</p>
                        <p>Inimitable tabla virtuoso and Chan Centre audience favourite Zakir Hussain is at it again, this time
                            turning his brilliant mind to the intersection of jazz and Indian music. The percussion master
                            has joined forces with the great jazz bassist, composer, and arranger Dave Holland to form an
                            ensemble that pays tribute to pioneering musicians and composers who inspire one another from
                            opposite sides of the world. This connection between genres began with Hollywood musicals of
                            the 30s and 40s, building a bridge that is now traversed in both directions. The influence of
                            Indian classical music on jazz is widely known; the influence of jazz on the popular music of
                            India less so. Crosscurrents explores new and exciting musical terrain while highlighting the
                            important legacy of improvisation that is widely celebrated in both traditions.</p>
